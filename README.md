My assignment for Innovaccer

The following is my assignment for innovacer hackercamp.
I am applying for SDE-Platform Intern.
The websites i have used for information in my assignment are imdb.com and next-episode.net.The code has been written in python.
I created a new email-ID as sendersmailid@gmail.com to send these emails.The password is as mentioned.I used Jupyter Notebook for writing this code and hence the file submitted is .pynb file.

The details about this assignment are as follows:

  a) First of all i have written a code to insert my input data into a MYSQL table.The host,password and other details have to be modified      to suit the local host.
  b) I am checking for case 3 first where next-episode.net tells me if my TV series has ended by displaying status cancelled/ended.
  c) Next, I am checking if episode date for next epsiode is available,again from next-episode.net.
  d) The only case left is case II where the year has to be displayed for next season which is checked through IMDB database.
  e) In case there is an error an error message is displayed.
  
  Care was taken to avoid any output,input format errors.
